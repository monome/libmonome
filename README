libmonome v1.2:

	libmonome is a library for easy interaction with monome devices. It
	currently runs on Linux (on which it is primarily developed), OpenBSD, and
	Darwin/OS X.

	It was developed to make monome devices easy to use with programming
	languages like C and Python, and adding wrappers for use in your favorite
	language with a suitable FFI is straightforward.

	libmonome has support for 40h and series devices through a unified API,
	and by default includes a third backend which wraps around the OSC
	protocol and presents the same API as a physical device. This means that a
	program written using libmonome can, at runtime, decide whether to
	communicate with a running monomeserial instance over OSC or whether to
	access the physical device directly.

	libmonome was written by william light (visinin on the monome forums).
